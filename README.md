**Hungarian Algorithm for Assignment Problem**
The Hungarian Algorithm is an optimization algorithm used to solve the Assignment Problem , which is a combinatorial optimization problem. In the Assignment Problem, N tasks should be assigned to N agents (1 task per agent). Each agent performs each task with a given cost. The objective is to minimize the total cost. The algorithm was developed by Harold Kuhn in 1955 and independently by James Munkres in 1957, and it's also known as the Munkres or Kuhn-Munkres algorithm.

**About the Code**
This Python code provides an implementation of the Hungarian Algorithm for solving the Assignment Problem.

-The implementation is encapsulated within the Assignment_Problem.py file, which contains class HungarianAlgorithm that contains methods for finding the optimal assignment, calculating the total cost, and generating binary assignment matrices.

-The test cases and the main are encapsulated within the Test_cases.py file.

**Dependencies**
NumPy: The code relies on NumPy for array manipulation and mathematical operations.
